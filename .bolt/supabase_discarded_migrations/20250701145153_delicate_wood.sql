/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in user_settings policies

  1. Policy Changes
    - Remove the problematic admin policy that causes infinite recursion
    - Simplify admin check to avoid circular references
    - Keep basic user access policies simple and safe

  2. Security
    - Users can still view and update their own settings
    - Admin functionality will be handled at the application level
    - Remove complex policy that references user_settings within user_settings policy
*/

-- Drop the problematic admin policies that cause infinite recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all user settings" ON user_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update all payment records" ON user_payments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all payment records" ON user_payments;

-- Keep simple, safe policies for user_settings
-- Users can view and update their own settings
-- (These policies already exist and are safe)

-- For user_payments, keep simple policies without complex admin checks
-- The admin functionality will be handled at the application level instead of database policies
