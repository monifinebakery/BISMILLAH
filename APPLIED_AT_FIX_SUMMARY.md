# Applied_at Field Error Fix

## Problem Description
The error `Error updating status: Error: record "new" has no field "applied_at"` was occurring when trying to update purchase status. This happened because:

1. The database schema had been migrated to remove the `applied_at` field as part of the manual warehouse synchronization implementation
2. Some cached/compiled JavaScript code was still trying to reference or set this field
3. Database triggers or functions might have been left behind that tried to set the field

## Root Cause
- The `applied_at` field was removed from the `purchases` table during the warehouse synchronization migration
- Browser cache contained compiled JavaScript that still referenced this field
- Possible database triggers or functions were still trying to set the field

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Cleanup
Created comprehensive migration scripts:
- `database_fixes/fix_applied_at_error.sql` - Immediate fix script
- `supabase/migrations/20250822150000_remove_applied_at_field.sql` - Migration script
- Updated `database_fixes/schema_updates.sql` - Enhanced with applied_at cleanup

The scripts:
- Remove the `applied_at` column completely
- Drop any dependent policies and triggers
- Remove related indexes
- Clean up any functions that might reference the field

### 2. Application Cache Cleanup
- Cleared Vite build cache (`npm run clean`)
- Restarted development server with fresh cache
- This ensures no cached JavaScript references the removed field

### 3. Manual Synchronization Approach
The application now uses manual warehouse synchronization via:
- `applyPurchaseToWarehouse()` function when status changes to 'completed'
- `reversePurchaseFromWarehouse()` function when cancelling/deleting completed purchases
- Manual WAC (Weighted Average Cost) calculation

## Testing Steps
1. Start the application (development server is running on http://localhost:5173)
2. Navigate to purchase management
3. Try updating a purchase status to 'completed'
4. Verify no "applied_at" errors occur
5. Check that warehouse stock is properly updated via manual sync

## Prevention
- The database schema is now properly cleaned
- Future deployments should use the migration scripts
- Application code now only uses manual synchronization
- No more automatic database triggers for warehouse sync

## Files Modified/Created
- `database_fixes/fix_applied_at_error.sql` (new)
- `supabase/migrations/20250822150000_remove_applied_at_field.sql` (new)
- `database_fixes/schema_updates.sql` (updated)

## Manual Sync Benefits
- Full control over when and how warehouse updates occur
- Easier debugging of synchronization issues
- No race conditions between database triggers and application logic
- Clear audit trail of warehouse changes
