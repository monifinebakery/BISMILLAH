# Dynamic Import Conflicts Resolution

## Overview
We've successfully resolved the most critical dynamic import conflicts in the BISMILLAH project that were preventing proper code splitting.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. App.tsx Conflict (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** 
- `src/App.tsx` was being both dynamically imported by `src/utils/safariUtils.ts` and statically imported by `src/main.tsx`
- This prevented Vite from properly code-splitting the main application component

**Solution:**
- Removed the dynamic import from `src/utils/safariUtils.ts`
- The `preloadCriticalResources` function in `safariUtils.ts` was using `import.meta.glob` to preload `App.tsx`, which created the conflict
- Removed the `import.meta.glob` usage for `App.tsx` since it's already statically imported in `main.tsx`

### 2. AuthContext.tsx Conflict (RESOLVED)
**Problem:**
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` was being both dynamically imported by `src/utils/safariUtils.ts` and statically imported by many other files
- This caused the auth context to be loaded in multiple chunks

**Solution:**
- Removed the dynamic import from `src/utils/safariUtils.ts`
- The `preloadCriticalResources` function was also preloading `AuthContext.tsx` via `import.meta.glob`, which created the conflict
- Removed the `import.meta.glob` usage for `AuthContext.tsx` since it's already statically imported throughout the application

## Remaining Conflicts
While we've resolved the most critical conflicts, there are still some remaining issues that should be addressed:

1. **Supabase Client** - Used both dynamically and statically in many files
2. **Warehouse Context** - Used both dynamically and statically
3. **Financial Context** - Used both dynamically and statically
4. **Order Events Utilities** - Used both dynamically and statically
5. **Profit Analysis Context** - Used both dynamically and statically
6. **Profit Dashboard** - Used both dynamically and statically

## Next Steps

### Short-term:
1. Review the remaining conflicts in `DYNAMIC_STATIC_IMPORT_CONFLICTS_DETAILED.md`
2. Prioritize fixing the most impactful conflicts (Supabase Client, Warehouse Context)

### Medium-term:
1. Establish coding guidelines for consistent import patterns
2. Implement linting rules to prevent future conflicts
3. Create a unified module loading strategy

### Long-term:
1. Set up automated bundle analysis to catch these issues early
2. Regular performance audits to ensure optimal code splitting
3. Consider migrating to a more consistent lazy loading pattern throughout the application

## Verification
- Build process now completes without the App.tsx and AuthContext.tsx conflicts
- Application functionality remains intact
- Bundle sizes should be slightly improved due to better code splitting
