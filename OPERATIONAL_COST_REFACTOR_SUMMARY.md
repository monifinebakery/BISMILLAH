# Operational Cost Page Refactoring Summary

## Overview
We've successfully refactored the OperationalCostPage to improve code splitting and organization. The refactoring focused on breaking down the large OperationalCostPage.tsx file into smaller, more manageable components while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
- Created a new `features` directory under `src/components/operational-costs/` to house the new components
- Organized components into logical groups for better maintainability

### 2. Component Restructuring
- **OperationalCostPage.tsx**: Simplified to only include the provider wrapper
- **OperationalCostContent.tsx**: Contains the main logic and state management
- **MainContent.tsx**: Handles the main UI layout and tab structure
- **DialogManager.tsx**: Manages all dialog components (CostFormDialog, QuickSetupTemplates, BulkEditDialog, BulkDeleteDialog)
- **LoadingState.tsx**: Loading state component (converted to default export)
- **EmptyState.tsx**: Empty state component (converted to default export)

### 3. Hook Optimization
- **useOperationalCostLogic.ts**: Extracted core logic from the main component into a dedicated hook
- Consolidated state management, effects, and business logic into this hook
- Reduced complexity in the main component

### 4. Import Fixes
- Updated all imports to correctly reference default exports
- Fixed import issues that were causing build errors
- Cleaned up component references in index files

### 5. Code Splitting Improvements
- Reduced the size of the main OperationalCostPage component
- Improved lazy loading potential by creating smaller, focused components
- Enhanced maintainability by separating concerns

## Benefits
1. **Improved Performance**: Smaller bundle sizes and better code splitting
2. **Better Maintainability**: Logic is now separated into focused modules
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Each component has a clear, single responsibility
4. **Easier Testing**: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation
5. **Scalability**: New features can be added more easily without affecting existing code

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Production build completes successfully
- All existing functionality remains intact
- No breaking changes to the public API

This refactoring maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving the code structure and performance characteristics of the Operational Cost Page.
