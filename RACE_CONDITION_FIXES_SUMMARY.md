# Race Condition Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Warehouse Stock Update Race Conditions
**Problem**: Multiple concurrent processes updating the same warehouse items could overwrite each other's changes without incorporating both updates.

**Fix**: 
- Modified `applyPurchaseToWarehouse` and `reversePurchaseFromWarehouse` functions to use atomic updates with row-level locking
- Added `select()` to update queries to get updated data
- Updated both the purchase sync service and reverse function

### 2. Financial Transaction Creation Race Conditions
**Problem**: Possible duplicate financial transactions when the same order is processed simultaneously by multiple processes.

**Fix**:
- Modified `addFinancialTransaction` function to handle unique constraint violations gracefully
- Added unique constraint on financial_transactions table for (user_id, description, type)
- Updated `syncOrderToFinancialTransaction` to use insert with conflict handling
- Process orders in smaller batches to reduce contention

### 3. WAC (Weighted Average Cost) Update Race Conditions
**Problem**: Concurrent WAC recalculations could overwrite each other's results.

**Fix**:
- Added version column to bahan_baku table for optimistic locking
- Modified `recalculateItemWAC` function to use optimistic locking with version checking
- Only update if version matches to prevent overwrites

### 4. Order Completion Workflow Race Conditions
**Problem**: Stock deductions not properly synchronized when multiple orders are completed simultaneously.

**Fix**:
- Improved `complete_order_and_deduct_stock` stored procedure with explicit row-level locking
- Added explicit locking of warehouse items before updating
- Improved `reverse_order_completion` function with similar locking

## Migration Files Created

1. `20250920100000_add_unique_constraint_financial_transactions.sql` - Adds unique constraint to prevent duplicate financial transactions
2. `20250920100100_add_version_column_bahan_baku.sql` - Adds version column for optimistic locking on warehouse items
3. `20250920100200_improve_order_completion_with_locking.sql` - Improves order completion stored procedure with explicit locking
4. `20250920100300_improve_order_reversal_with_locking.sql` - Improves order reversal stored procedure with explicit locking

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/warehouse/services/core/purchaseSyncService.ts` - Added atomic updates with row-level locking
2. `src/components/financial/services/financialApi.ts` - Added conflict handling for financial transactions
3. `src/components/warehouse/services/warehouseSyncService.ts` - Added optimistic locking for WAC updates
4. `src/utils/orderFinancialSync.ts` - Improved race condition handling and batch processing

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Data Consistency**: Prevents overwrites and ensures all updates are properly applied
2. **Concurrency Safety**: Multiple processes can run simultaneously without corrupting data
3. **Performance**: Batch processing reduces database load while maintaining consistency
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of race conditions with appropriate fallbacks
5. **Scalability**: System can handle increased load without data integrity issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run concurrent tests with multiple processes updating the same warehouse items
2. Test financial transaction creation with simultaneous order completions
3. Verify WAC calculations remain consistent under concurrent updates
4. Test order completion workflows with multiple simultaneous orders
5. Monitor database performance to ensure no significant degradation

These fixes ensure the BISMILLAH application maintains data integrity even under high concurrent load scenarios.
