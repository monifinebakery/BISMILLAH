# Warehouse Miscalculation Fixes - Summary

## Problem Analysis

The warehouse system was experiencing miscalculations due to several issues:

1. **Missing Database Triggers**: No automatic calculation of Weighted Average Cost (WAC) when purchases were completed
2. **Inconsistent Price Sources**: Different components using different price values (base price vs WAC)
3. **Inadequate Validation**: Purchase completion allowed invalid data that could corrupt warehouse calculations
4. **No Manual Recovery**: No mechanism to fix data inconsistencies when they occurred

## Solution Overview

The fix implements a comprehensive approach to ensure accurate warehouse calculations:

### 1. Database Trigger System (`database_fixes/warehouse_wac_trigger.sql`)

**Features:**
- Automatic WAC calculation when purchases are completed
- Stock adjustment when purchase status changes 
- Proper handling of purchase modifications and deletions
- Rollback capability for cancelled/deleted purchases

**Key Functions:**
- `calculate_warehouse_wac()` - Calculates weighted average cost
- `apply_purchase_to_warehouse()` - Updates stock and WAC on completion
- `reverse_purchase_from_warehouse()` - Reverses effects when needed
- `handle_purchase_warehouse_sync()` - Main trigger function
- `sync_all_warehouse_wac()` - Manual recalculation function

**Trigger Logic:**
```sql
-- On purchase completion: Update stock and calculate new WAC
-- On purchase modification: Reverse old values, apply new values  
-- On purchase deletion: Reverse effects if purchase was applied
```

### 2. Enhanced Warehouse Utilities (`warehouseUtils.ts`)

**Improvements:**
- Consistent price calculation using WAC when available
- Fallback to base price when WAC is not available
- Better debugging with price difference logging
- Enhanced export data with pricing method information
- New stock value calculation using effective prices

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
getEffectiveUnitPrice(item) // WAC > base price priority
isUsingWac(item)           // Check if using WAC pricing
calculateStockValue(items) // Total value using effective prices
```

### 3. Purchase Validation System (`purchaseValidation.ts`)

**Features:**
- Comprehensive validation before purchase completion
- Warehouse consistency checks against existing data
- Detection of calculation inconsistencies 
- Warning system for data anomalies
- Prevention of precision/rounding issues

**Validation Types:**
- Essential data validation (ID, quantity, price, unit)
- Subtotal consistency checks
- Total calculation verification  
- Warehouse data consistency
- Extreme value detection

### 4. Warehouse Sync Service (`warehouseSyncService.ts`)

**Capabilities:**
- Manual WAC recalculation for all items
- Warehouse data consistency checking
- Individual item fixing
- Data integrity validation
- Comprehensive sync reporting

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
recalculateAllWAC()        // Recalculate all WAC values
checkWarehouseConsistency() // Find data inconsistencies
fixWarehouseItem()         // Fix individual items  
validateWarehouseIntegrity() // Check data integrity
generateSyncReport()       // Full diagnostic report
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Changes
```sql
-- Run the database trigger file
\i database_fixes/warehouse_wac_trigger.sql

-- Ensure purchases index uses consistent name
\i database_fixes/purchases_user_index.sql
```

### Step 2: Update Frontend Code
The following files have been created/updated:
- `src/components/warehouse/services/warehouseUtils.ts` (updated)
- `src/components/purchase/utils/purchaseValidation.ts` (new)  
- `src/components/warehouse/services/warehouseSyncService.ts` (new)

### Step 3: Run Tests
```bash
npm test src/components/warehouse/__tests__/warehouseCalculations.test.ts
```

## Data Flow

### Purchase Completion Process
```
1. User clicks "Complete Purchase" 
2. Frontend validates purchase data
3. API calls purchaseApi.setPurchaseStatus()
4. Database trigger fires on status change
5. Trigger calculates new WAC and updates stock
6. Frontend reflects updated warehouse data
```

### WAC Calculation Formula
```
New WAC = (Current Stock × Current WAC + New Quantity × New Price) / 
          (Current Stock + New Quantity)
```

### Error Recovery Process
```
1. User notices incorrect calculations
2. Run warehouse sync service diagnostic
3. Review consistency check results  
4. Apply automatic fixes or manual corrections
5. Verify calculations are now correct
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Automatic Accuracy**
- All warehouse calculations update automatically when purchases are completed
- No manual intervention needed for routine operations
- Consistent pricing across all components

### 2. **Data Integrity**
- Comprehensive validation prevents bad data entry
- Triggers ensure database consistency
- Recovery mechanisms handle edge cases

### 3. **Transparency**
- Clear indication of which pricing method is being used
- Detailed logging for debugging purposes
- Export data includes pricing methodology  

### 4. **Flexibility**
- Manual sync capability for fixing issues
- Configurable validation levels
- Support for different calculation methods

## Testing Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ WAC price calculations and fallbacks
- ✅ Stock value calculations using effective prices
- ✅ Purchase validation scenarios  
- ✅ Warehouse consistency checks
- ✅ Export data preparation
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling
- ✅ Integration scenarios

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Monitoring
1. Check warehouse sync reports weekly
2. Monitor for consistency issues  
3. Review validation logs for patterns
4. Verify WAC calculations on key items

### Troubleshooting Checklist
1. **Incorrect WAC values**: Run `sync_all_warehouse_wac()` function
2. **Missing stock updates**: Check purchase trigger is active
3. **Validation errors**: Review purchase data for inconsistencies
4. **Performance issues**: Check database indexes are in place

### Database Maintenance
```sql
-- Check trigger status
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'trigger_purchase_warehouse_sync';

-- Manual WAC recalculation  
SELECT * FROM sync_all_warehouse_wac('user-id-here');

-- Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bahan_baku WHERE harga_rata_rata IS NULL 
  AND id IN (SELECT DISTINCT (item->>'bahan_baku_id')::UUID 
             FROM purchases, jsonb_array_elements(items) item 
             WHERE status = 'completed');
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Data
1. Run the database trigger SQL file
2. Execute `sync_all_warehouse_wac()` for all users to recalculate WAC
3. Review and fix any consistency issues identified
4. Update frontend components to use new utilities

### For New Installations  
1. Include trigger SQL in initial schema setup
2. Ensure proper validation is enabled
3. Configure monitoring and alerting as needed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the system:
- Real-time WAC tracking dashboard
- Automated alerts for significant price changes
- Advanced forecasting based on WAC trends
- Integration with external pricing APIs
- Batch import validation for large datasets
