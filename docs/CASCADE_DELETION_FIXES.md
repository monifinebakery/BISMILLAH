# Cascade Deletion Fixes & Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive cascade deletion fixes implemented to ensure that when data is deleted in the application, related data in Supabase is also properly cleaned up.

## üö® Problem Identified
Previously, some API deletion operations only removed the primary record without cleaning up related/dependent data, potentially causing:
- Orphaned records in related tables
- Inconsistent data state
- Performance issues from accumulating unused data
- Potential data integrity violations

## ‚úÖ Fixed Components

### 1. Asset Management (`assetApi.ts`)
**Before**: Simple delete of asset record only
**After**: Enhanced cascade deletion with:
- ‚úÖ Cleanup of related financial transactions (depreciation, sales, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Logging for debugging and audit trail
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling for cleanup failures

```typescript
// NEW: Enhanced deleteAsset function
export const deleteAsset = async (id: string, userId: string): Promise<void> => {
  // üßπ CLEANUP: Delete related financial transactions
  const { error: cleanupError } = await supabase
    .from('financial_transactions')
    .delete()
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .eq('related_id', id);
  // ... then delete the asset
}
```

### 2. Warehouse Management (`warehouseApi.ts`)
**Before**: Basic delete of bahan_baku record only
**After**: Enhanced cascade deletion with:
- ‚úÖ Cleanup of related `pemakaian_bahan` records (material usage)
- ‚úÖ Logging for deleted materials
- ‚úÖ Bulk delete enhancement with batch cleanup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: JSONB references in recipes require database-level cleanup (added in migration)

```typescript
// NEW: Enhanced deleteBahanBaku function
async deleteBahanBaku(id: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // üßπ CLEANUP: Delete related pemakaian_bahan records
  const { error: usageCleanupError } = await supabase
    .from('pemakaian_bahan')
    .delete()
    .eq('bahan_baku_id', id);
  // ... then delete the material
}
```

### 3. Financial Transactions (`financialApi.ts`)
**Before**: Simple delete of transaction record only
**After**: Enhanced cascade deletion with:
- ‚úÖ Refresh materialized views (dashboard_financial_summary)
- ‚úÖ Cleanup logging and audit trail
- ‚úÖ Bulk delete enhancement with batch view refresh
- ‚úÖ Better error handling for view refresh failures

```typescript
// NEW: Enhanced deleteFinancialTransaction function
export const deleteFinancialTransaction = async (id: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  // Delete transaction then refresh views
  await supabase.rpc('refresh_dashboard_views');
  // ... with comprehensive logging
}
```

### 4. Operational Costs (`operationalCostApi.ts`)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already properly implemented
- Cleans up related financial transactions
- Triggers app_settings recalculation
- Invalidates related caches

## üóÑÔ∏è Database-Level Improvements

### New Migration: `20250829120000_add_cascade_delete_constraints.sql`

#### 1. Enhanced Triggers
```sql
-- Clean up JSONB references in recipes when bahan_baku is deleted
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_cleanup_recipe_material_references
    AFTER DELETE ON bahan_baku
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION cleanup_recipe_material_references();
```

#### 2. Performance Indexes
```sql
-- Better performance on cascade operations
CREATE INDEX idx_financial_transactions_related_id ON financial_transactions(related_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_financial_transactions_user_related ON financial_transactions(user_id, related_id);
```

#### 3. Data Integrity Functions
```sql
-- Function to check for orphaned records
CREATE FUNCTION check_orphaned_records() RETURNS TABLE(table_name text, orphaned_count bigint);
```

#### 4. Enhanced View Refresh
```sql
-- Comprehensive materialized view refresh
CREATE FUNCTION refresh_financial_views() RETURNS void;
```

## üîÑ Existing Foreign Key Constraints (Already Good)

The database already has proper CASCADE DELETE constraints for user data:
```sql
-- All user-owned tables have this pattern:
ALTER TABLE "table_name" 
ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_table_user" 
FOREIGN KEY ("user_id") REFERENCES "auth"."users"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Specific examples:
- pemakaian_bahan.bahan_baku_id ‚Üí bahan_baku.id ON DELETE CASCADE ‚úÖ
- All user_id fields ‚Üí auth.users.id ON DELETE CASCADE ‚úÖ
```

## üìä Impact Summary

### Before vs After Comparison

| Component | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Assets** | Basic delete only | Delete + financial cleanup | ‚úÖ No orphaned financial records |
| **Warehouse** | Basic delete only | Delete + usage cleanup + logging | ‚úÖ No orphaned usage records |
| **Financial** | Basic delete only | Delete + view refresh + logging | ‚úÖ Consistent dashboard data |
| **Operational** | Already good | Enhanced triggers | ‚úÖ Better database-level cleanup |

### Performance Benefits
- ‚úÖ Reduced orphaned records
- ‚úÖ Better query performance from proper indexes
- ‚úÖ Consistent materialized view state
- ‚úÖ Automatic JSONB reference cleanup

### Monitoring Benefits
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Data integrity check functions
- ‚úÖ Orphaned record detection

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Asset Deletion**:
   - [ ] Delete an asset that has related financial transactions
   - [ ] Verify financial transactions are cleaned up
   - [ ] Check logs for proper cleanup confirmation

2. **Warehouse Deletion**:
   - [ ] Delete a bahan_baku that has pemakaian_bahan records
   - [ ] Verify usage records are cleaned up
   - [ ] Test bulk delete with multiple materials

3. **Financial Deletion**:
   - [ ] Delete financial transactions
   - [ ] Verify dashboard views are refreshed
   - [ ] Check materialized view consistency

### Database Testing
```sql
-- Check for orphaned records after testing
SELECT * FROM check_orphaned_records();

-- Verify materialized views are up to date
SELECT schemaname, matviewname, ispopulated 
FROM pg_matviews 
WHERE matviewname IN ('dashboard_financial_summary', 'pemakaian_bahan_daily_mv');
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Apply the migration**:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Verify triggers are active**:
   ```sql
   SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, action_statement 
   FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%cleanup%';
   ```

3. **Test cascade deletion** in staging environment

4. **Monitor logs** for cleanup confirmations

## üîß Maintenance

### Regular Monitoring
- Run `check_orphaned_records()` monthly to detect any integrity issues
- Monitor materialized view refresh performance
- Check cleanup function logs for any failures

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding soft delete patterns for critical data
- Implement audit trails for major deletions
- Add batch cleanup jobs for large datasets

## üìù Developer Notes

### Key Principles Applied
1. **Defense in Depth**: Both application-level and database-level cleanup
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Cleanup failures don't block primary operations
3. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
4. **Performance**: Proper indexing for cascade operations

### Code Patterns Used
```typescript
// Standard cleanup pattern
try {
  // 1. Get record info for logging
  const existing = await getRecord(id);
  
  // 2. Clean up related data
  await cleanupRelatedData(id, userId);
  
  // 3. Delete primary record
  await deletePrimaryRecord(id, userId);
  
  // 4. Log success
  console.log(`‚úÖ Deleted "${existing.name}" with cleanup`);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle errors gracefully
  throw new Error(`Deletion failed: ${error.message}`);
}
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ All cascade deletion improvements implemented and ready for deployment
**Next Steps**: Apply migration and perform testing in staging environment
